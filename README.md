This represents a simple ePortfolio website. An ePortfolio is an online platform where individuals can showcase their work, experience, and projects. In this case, the portfolio is built by me Jewel Jade Tapulgo, a web developer who presents their skills, projects, and a way for visitors to get in touch.

The webpage is divided into several key sections:

Header – Contains a welcome message, profile photo, and a short introduction.
About Me – Provides a brief description of the individual’s skills and interests, with a link to their GitHub profile.
Projects – Displays a list of projects with short descriptions and links to GitHub repositories.
Contact – A contact form to allow users to send messages via a form submission service (Formspree).
Footer – Contains a copyright notice.
